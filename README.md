# Slaughterhouse 5 Game

After reading "Slaughterhouse 5" by Kurt Vonnegut for my English class, I was tasked with creating a creative project for our final exam. My project was a virtual reality game, that takes the user through Billy's adventure through space and time.

You can view some of the source code here:
- [TimeManipulation.cs](/Assets/TimeManipulation.cs)

## APK File

This comes with a file named [EnglishProject.apk](/EnglishProject.apk), and this file can be downloaded and used with SideQuest to be ported to an Oculus Quest virtual reality headset.

You can find out how to download SideQuest [here](https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest).

> Note: SideQuest only works with the Oculus Quest, Oculus Quest 2, and Oculus Quest 3. For the Oculus Rift or non-oculus headsets, different download methods must be used, and the APK file may not be compatible.
